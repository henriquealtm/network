# Network Structure  
  
Network requests structures sample using [Retrofit] (https://square.github.io/retrofit/) as the HTTP client. Using the [The Marvel Comics API] (https://developer.marvel.com/) to consume and list Marvel's characters.  

Implemented two network request sample structures with [coroutine suspend functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/composing-suspending-functions.html) and [coroutines flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html).
